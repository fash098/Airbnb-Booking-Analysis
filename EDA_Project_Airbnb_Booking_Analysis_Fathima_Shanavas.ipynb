        "\n",
        " Private rooms are the most revenue-generating room type, especially in popular neighborhoods like Jamaica (Queens), Harlem (Manhattan), and East Elmhurst (Queens).\n",
        " To optimize pricing and maximize revenue, consider offering more private rooms in these popular neighborhoods.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        " Manhattan and Brooklyn are the most popular boroughs among guests, with Queens also hosting a significant number of guests.\n",
        " Consider increasing the number of listings in Manhattan and Brooklyn to further cater to guest demand.\n",
        " While Bronx and Staten Island have lower guest numbers, it might be worth conducting further research to understand any geographical disadvantages that could be impacting demand in these areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Room Type Preference by Borough:**\n",
        "\n",
        " Guests overwhelmingly prefer entire home/apartment rentals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with private rooms also being popular.\n",
        " In Queens, there's a more balanced preference between entire home/apartment and shared rooms.\n",
        " In Bronx and Staten Island, prioritize offering entire home/apartment and private room options over shared rooms.\n",
        " Consider adjusting the listing distribution in each borough to align with these preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Top Revenue-Generating Neighborhoods:**\n",
        "\n",
        " Focus on neighborhoods like Williamsburg (Brooklyn), Midtown (Manhattan), and Upper West Side (Manhattan) for higher revenue.\n",
        " Since most of the top revenue-yielding neighborhoods are in Manhattan, ensure that listings in these neighborhoods are well-maintained, competitively priced, and offer exceptional amenities.\n",

        "- **Host Performance and Listings:**\n",
        "\n",
        " Investigate why the host with Host ID '219517861' is outperforming others significantly. Analyze their properties, services, and amenities to identify best practices.\n",

        " Review the pricing strategy for listings in different boroughs. For instance, since Manhattan and Brooklyn have higher price ranges, ensure that the prices are justified by the quality of accommodations and services.\n",

        " High correlation between reviews per month and the number of reviews suggests that actively reviewed properties tend to have more bookings.\n",
        " Host ID's correlation with availability, listings, and availability through 365 days could indicate that certain hosts are more consistent in managing and maintaining their properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Negative Growth Considerations:**\n",
        "\n",
        " Shared rooms are less popular and generate less revenue compared to entire apartments/homes or private rooms. While you might want to continue offering shared rooms for budget travelers, the focus should be on increasing the availability and quality of entire apartments/homes and private rooms.\n",
