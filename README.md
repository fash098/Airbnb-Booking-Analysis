# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis
Airbnb Booking Analysis - EDA Project
Since 2008, Airbnb has facilitated a novel and personalized approach to travel for both guests and hosts, which has resulted in its recognition as a one-of-a-kind service worldwide. The company places great importance on data analysis, particularly when it comes to the millions of listings available on its platform. These listings generate an immense amount of data, which can be used to enhance security, make informed business decisions, gain insight into customer and host behavior and performance, and guide marketing efforts, as well as implement innovative additional services. The dataset in question comprises approximately 49,000 observations, with a mix of categorical and numerical values across 16 columns.

Our aim is to explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings (not limited to these) such as :

What are the most popular cities for Airbnb bookings?

Are there any geographic patterns in Airbnb bookings (e.g. certain neighborhoods or areas that are more popular)?

What types of properties (e.g. apartments, houses, private rooms) are most popular among Airbnb guests?

Who are some of the best hosts and some insights about their listings?

What is the average length of stay for Airbnb guests?

Which is the most expensive location? How does price range differ for different locations?
